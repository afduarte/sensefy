<p>Sensefy is a Enterprise Semantic Search Engine developed by Zaizi. Built on top of leading open source software, it provides users with advanced enterprise search functionalities.</p>

<p>Sensefy is <strong>Semantic</strong> because it enriches the documents semantically to extract entities such as people, organisations and 
places and improve the user's search experience by providing intelligent search functionalities.</p>

<p>Sensefy is <strong>Enterprise</strong> because it offers federated search, allowing the user to index the content from heterogeneous data sources while ensuring the security restrictions of the source systems. Users only see the documents they are allowed to see in the search results. </p>
