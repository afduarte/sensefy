<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sensefy is a Enterprise Semantic Search Engine developed by Zaizi. Built on top of leading open source software, it provides users with advanced enterprise search functionalities.</p>

<p>Sensefy is <strong>Semantic</strong> because it enriches the documents semantically to extract entities such as people, organisations and 
places and improve the user's search experience by providing intelligent search functionalities.</p>

<p>Sensefy is <strong>Enterprise</strong> because it offers federated search, allowing the user to index the content from heterogeneous data sources while ensuring the security restrictions of the source systems. Users only see the documents they are allowed to see in the search results. </p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><b>Federated search across multiple repositories:</b> Powerful federated search capabilities enable you to search across all data sources in the organisation like Alfresco, File System, Emails, Windows Share and more.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Faster performance:</b> Retrieval time of colossal amounts of content is quicker with Apache Solr, search results can be viewed at once from all sources, or separately for each data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Automatic classification:</b> Semantic facets automatically classify search results and offer the capability to search by entity types.</p></li>
<li><p><b>User permissions:</b> Search solution preserves access permissions to content for different users in different systems, without having to implement additional security controls.</p></li>

<p>Entity driven search is a step ahead from ordinary keyword search and enables natural language as search terms. The entity description and search results can be obtained on retrieval.</p>
<p>User can retrieve more relevant and accurate results for each search result that appears for a specific search term.</p></li>
