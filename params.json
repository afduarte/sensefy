Semantic enrichment enables you to find similar documents with high accuracy and relevancy.\r\n* Semantic smart auto complete eases the user’s search task by prompting possible results and suggestions on typing the search term.\r\n* Entity driven search is a step ahead from ordinary keyword search and enables natural language as search terms. The entity description and search results can be obtained on retrieval.\r\n* User can retrieve more relevant and accurate results for each search result that appears for a specific search term.\r\nKey Business Benefits\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n* Increase cost savings with open standards that allow seamless integration with multiple data sources, so Sensefy is the most cost-effective among proprietary solutions.\r\n* Improve user productivity through a federated search that offer one stop access to all the content in the enterprise from files, to documents, digital assets and records.\r\n* Combination of Apache Solr and ManifoldCF perfects the search function with operational efficiency and security.\r\n* Content searched within your enterprise becomes smarter as you go because our solution will automatically tag and link data.\r\n* Scalability and speed of performance is ensured with the powerful Solr technology and search architecture. \r\n\r\n### Support Or Contact\r\nThe issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests. \r\n\r\nCommunity support for Sensefy is available via Stackoverflow.
